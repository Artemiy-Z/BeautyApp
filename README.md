# info

This is one of my first projects in Android Development. While developing it, I've learned about many things that make up components of client-server apps.

It features:

1. Creating comfortable and useful User Interface
2. Managing asynchronous processes (file downloads and requests from Database)
3. Making working data structure which supports all necessary functions

# result

At the end of development I have created an App, where you can register with phone number (similar to email, without confirmation code), 
view what services you what to order, and also view a list of services that you planned.
